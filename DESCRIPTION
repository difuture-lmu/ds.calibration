Description: Calculate the calibration of a model on DataSHIELD servers. The methods provided are the
    Brier score and calibration curves. Note that DataSHIELD uses an option `datashield.privacyLevel`
    to indicate the minimal amount of numbers required to be allowed to share an aggregated value
    of these numbers. This options is set to 5 by default. It is set in the `zzz.R` file of this
    package.
